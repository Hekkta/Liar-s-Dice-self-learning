# Liar-s-Dice-self-learning

I use q-learning to teach the program to play liar's dice with only 1 dice.

My friend and I had much debate about which player is more likely to win, first or second with only one dice.

Even though this is a very simple game it's not clear who has the advantage or even what the best way to play is.

I let the program learn from 100 million games which took about 1.5 hours and then had it play another million while keeping tally of the wins.

The player who went second had an advantage of about 1%, so it was a close call as suspected.
